HAUMelitta
==========

HAUMelitta is a project intended to connect a coffeepot to the Internet through a Twitter account.

It our modest contribution to the Web of object.

Why this name ?
---------------

The name in contraction of HAUM (our hackerspace) and Melitta (well-known coffepot manufacturer).

How does it works ?
-------------------

The coffeepot has its own Twitter account (@HAUMelitta) and API tokens/secrets had been generated to get updates on the
Pi.

When a tweet containing the right keyword is emitted from one of the masters, the Pi commutes a static relay that switch
on the coffeepot.
